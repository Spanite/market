    <h1 class=" capitalize sm:text-5xl text-3xl font-black italic mb-6"> what are cfds?</h1>
    <p class=" text-base font-medium tracking-wide leading-6">The abbreviation CFDs stands for Contract for Difference. 
    A CFD offers traders an opportunity to possibly earn a profit from speculating on the price movement of an underlying 
    asset, without actually owning the asset. A CFD is basically a contract between the buyer 
    and seller specifying a certain purchase price of an underlying asset in any of the major financial markets: Forex, Stocks, Indices, Commodities, Cryptocurrencies. During a specific timeframe, 
    the contract allows for profits or losses based on the changes in the price of the underlying asset.</p>

    <h2 class="capitalize font-black italic sm:text-4xl text-2xl mb-6 mt-4">how are CFDs traded?</h2>
    <p class="text-base font-medium tracking-wide leading-6">While trading CFDs, you are predicting the price movement of specific underlying assets.
     If your prediction is that the price of an underlying asset is going to rise, you would choose to buy,
     but if you speculate that the price is going to drop, you choose to sell the asset. You do not physically own 
     the asset when you are investing in CFDs, but you are investing in the chance to potentially earn a profit 
     from the movement of the asset. It is important to keep in mind
     that you can lose your investment if the assetâ€™s price should move in a direction opposite to your position.</p>

     <h3 class=" font-medium text-xl capitalize my-8">for example:</h3>
    <ol class="text-base font-medium tracking-wide leading-6 my-8">
        <li class="mb-6">1. You have researched the Amazon stock and you deduced that they indicate that the Amazon stock is going to plummet.
         After entering the FinancialMarket platform, 
        and checking the real-time graph, you decide that you agree, in this case, you would choose to sell.<li>

        <li>2. You listen to a financial podcast daily, and they indicated that the price of the Nasdaq 
        Composite might rise after an important announcement later that day. After performing your own 
        research and checking the graphs, 
        you agree with their assessment. In this case you would choose to buy.<li>
    </ol>


    <p class="text-base font-medium tracking-wide leading-6">In either of these cases, should you predict correctly, you would profit from these movements. However, an incorrect prediction would mean that you would lose your investment.
